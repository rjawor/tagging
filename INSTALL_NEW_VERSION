The tagger can easily be installed as an independent system. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the tagging repo from github (https://github.com/rjawor/tagging.git) into a chosen directory in /var/www/html (this path is currently harcoded in the GeneratorController file).
2. Create DB:
    a. go to tools/db
    b. generate db sql with the generateDBModel.sh script. The script takes one parameter - the name of the new db (e.g. mydb).
    c. log in to the mysql server and execute the resulting sql file (mysql --user=user --password=password --default-character-set=utf8 < mydb.sql). Add the mydb.sql to the repo.
3. Go to app/Config:
    a. copy core.php.example as core.php (the core.php file is in .gitignore).
    b. set the SystemInstallationPath setting to the folder you checked out the repo into, e.g. '/mytagger' (without trailing slash).
    c. set the SystemDescription setting to the name of the tagger (spaces allowed and recommended)
    d. set the SystemLogo to the name of the logo file (assumed to be found in app/webroot/img)
    e. copy database.php.example as database.php (the database.php file is in .gitignore). Adjust the file accordingly.
4. If desired, insert the init data from IA tagger to the new tagger by using tools/db/applySQL.sh (first parameter - dbname, second - sql file). IA tagger init sql's are in the tools/db/iatagger_init folder.
5. Set up the predefined statistics. Go to app/View/Statistics and copy the file predefined_stats.php.example as predefined_stats.php.
